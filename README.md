## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **backend**: Contains the Node.js backend code.
- **frontend**: Contains the React frontend code.
- **e2e-tests**: Contains end-to-end tests for the application.

# Getting Started

This section provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the MERN Booking App on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

## Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmrSayed0/mern-booking-app.git
cd mern-booking-app
```

## Backend Configuration

1. **Environment Files**: Navigate to the `backend` folder and create two files: `.env` and `.env.e2e`. Add the following contents to both files:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=

   JWT_SECRET_KEY=
   FRONTEND_URL=

   # Cloudinary Variables
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

   # Stripe
   STRIPE_API_KEY=
   ```

2. **MongoDB Setup**:

   - Sign up for an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - Create a new cluster and follow the instructions to set up a new database.
   - Once set up, obtain your MongoDB connection string and add it to the `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` variable in your `.env` files.
   - For the `.env.e2e` setup see "running automated tests" below

3. **Cloudinary Setup**:

   - Create an account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
   - Navigate to your dashboard to find your cloud name, API key, and API secret.
   - Add these details to the respective `CLOUDINARY_*` variables in your `.env` files.

4. **Stripe Setup**:

   - Sign up for a Stripe account at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
   - Find your API keys in the Stripe dashboard.
   - Add your Stripe API key to the `STRIPE_API_KEY` variable in your `.env` files.

5. **JWT_SECRET_KEY**:

   - This just needs to be any long, random string. You can google "secret key generator".

6. **Frontend URL**:
   - The `FRONTEND_URL` should point to the URL where your frontend application is running (typically `http://localhost:3000` if you're running it locally).

## Frontend Configuration

1. **Environment Files**: Navigate to the `frontend` folder and create a file: `.env`:

   ```plaintext
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=
   VITE_STRIPE_PUB_KEY=
   ```

2. **VITE_API_BASE_URLL**:
   - The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should point to the URL where your backend application is running (typically `http://localhost:7000` if you're running it locally).

## Running the Application

1. **Backend**:

   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Start the server: `npm start`.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Start the frontend application: `npm run dev`.
   - The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` but verify this in your command line terminal

## Running Automated Tests

1. **MongoDB Setup**:
   - You will ideally want to create a new mongoDb database for your tests to run against. This is to keep the data stable
   - Sign up for an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - Create a new project (e.g e2e tests)
   - Create a new cluster and follow the instructions to set up a new database.
   - Once set up, obtain your MongoDB connection string and add it to the `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` variable in your `.env.e2e` file.
2. **Importing Test Data into MongoDB**:

   - The repository contains a `data` folder at the root, which includes JSON files for a test user and a test hotel. You can import these into your MongoDB collections to quickly set up test data.
   - **Locate the Test User File**: In the `data` folder, find the file containing the test user data (likely named something like `test-users.json`).
   - **Open MongoDB Compass**: Launch MongoDB Compass and connect to your database.
   - **Select the Database**: In Compass, select the database you are using for the automated tests (created in step 1).
   - **Import User Data**:
     - Navigate to the `users` collection within your database. Create it if it doesn't exist
     - Click on the "Add Data" button and select "Import File".
     - Browse to the location of your `test-users.json` file and select it.
     - Choose JSON as the file format and click "Import".
     - The test user data will be added to the `users` collection.
     - user login: 1@1.com/password123
   - **Locate the Test Hotel File**:
     - Navigate to the `hotels` collection within your database. Create it if it doesn't exist
     - Repeat the import process as you did for the user data, but this time select the `test-hotel.json` file.
     - Ensure the file format is set to JSON and click "Import".
     - The test hotel data will be added to the `hotels` collection.

3. **Running tests**
   - In VS Code install the [Playwright extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)
   - Navigate to the `e2e-tests` directory.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Start the frontend and backend server using the steps above
   - [Using the Playwright extension to run the tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode#running-tests)
